# MQTT Light Control

This project demonstrates a web-based application to control a light using MQTT. It includes:
- A web interface to send ON/OFF commands.
- A Python script to simulate an IoT device that listens for MQTT messages.

## How to Use
1. Run the Python script (`light_simulation.py`) to simulate the IoT device.
2. Open `index.html` in a browser to control the light.
3. Click the "Turn ON" or "Turn OFF" buttons to send MQTT messages.
